        <h2 class="section-title">Company History</h2>
        <p>Berkeley Geoimaging was founded as an oil and gas exploration company focused on using geophysics to identify underdeveloped assets through seismic processing and technical expertise. Milton Righetti was one of the original members, acting as attorney and landman.</p>
        <p>In 2001, the company participated in its first wildcat well in Illinois, acquiring a working interest in the Forbes Lake field. The flagship Warren 1 well has produced over 2.6 million barrels of oil on its own. The field has produced over 4.5 million barrels total.</p>
        <p>In 2005, Berkeley Geoimaging, through BGI Resources, LLC, acquired a small producing field in Osage County, Oklahoma, generating just 8 barrels of oil per day. Over the next two decades, BGI Resources, LLC, as operator, developed the field into a 35-well portfolio with exclusive drilling concessions spanning over 100 square miles.</p>
        <p>Today, Berkeley Geoimaging, LLC manages both operated and non-operated assets across both states, with a team that combines legal, financial, and hands-on field expertise.</p>
        <p>Early non-operated projects included operations in the Gulf of America, New Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, and the North Sea. These ventures built the foundation of experience and relationships that shape the company.</p>
