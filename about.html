        <h2 class="section-title">Company History</h2>
        <p>Berkeley Geoimaging was formed as an oil and gas exploration company with a specific focus: using seismic interpretation to identify opportunities that conventional analysis would miss. The founding team brought together James Rector, a geophysicist from UC Berkeley, William Jahnke, and Milton Righetti, who served as attorney and landman. Seismic — as both a prospecting tool and a means of verifying drilling locations — was central to the company's identity from the start.</p>
        <p>In 2001, the company participated in its first wildcat well in Illinois, acquiring a working interest in the Forbes Lake field. The flagship Warren 1 well has produced over 2.6 million barrels of oil. The field has produced over 4.5 million barrels total.</p>
        <p>In 2005, Berkeley Geoimaging, through BGI Resources, LLC, acquired a small producing field in Osage County, Oklahoma, generating just 8 barrels of oil per day. Over the next two decades, BGI Resources, LLC, as operator, developed the field into a 35-well portfolio with exclusive drilling concessions spanning over 100 square miles. Seismic continues to play an active role in identifying and verifying drilling locations across the acreage the company controls in Osage County.</p>
        <p>Early non-operated projects included operations in the Gulf of America, New Mexico, Louisiana, Texas, and the North Sea. These ventures built the foundation of experience and relationships that continue to shape the company.</p>

    <!-- Team Note -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container container--narrow">
        <h2 class="section-title">Our Team</h2>
        <p>Over the past decade, Berkeley Geoimaging transitioned from maintaining in-house geology and geophysics processing to working with a focused network of experienced consultants. That shift has continued to yield strong results with significantly less overhead — a deliberate choice that keeps the company lean without sacrificing technical depth.</p>
        <p>On every drill, the company engages local field geologists and logging crews who know the formation. Well completions are arrived at collaboratively, with the full team involved in the decision. Mike Mackey, a well-regarded operator in Osage County who until recently also owned and operated a successful wireline company, brings hands-on completion expertise to each project. Mike and Jim Kunard have drilled and managed the majority of the company's wells over the past ten years, with a track record that reflects that experience.</p>
        <p>Day-to-day operations and administrative continuity are handled by Jim Kunard in the field and Cara Dillon, Office Manager, in Tulsa.</p>
