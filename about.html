        <h2 class="section-title">Company History</h2>
        <p>Berkeley Geoimaging was founded as a geophysics company to identify underdeveloped oil and gas assets through seismic processing and technical expertise. Milton Righetti was one of the original members, acting as attorney and landman.</p>
        <p>Early projects included operations in the Gulf of America, Tucumcari, and the North Sea. The North Sea project was eventually abandoned, but those early ventures built the foundation of experience and relationships that shaped the company.</p>
        <p>In 2001, Berkeley Geoimaging acquired what would become its flagship operation: a small producing field in Osage County, Oklahoma, generating just 8 barrels of oil per day. Over the next two decades, that acquisition grew into a 35-well portfolio with exclusive drilling concessions spanning over 100 square miles.</p>
        <p>The company also expanded into Illinois with a working interest in the Forbes Lake field, which has produced over 4.5 million barrels of oil.</p>
        <p>Today, Berkeley Geoimaging manages operated and non-operated assets across both states, with a team that combines legal, financial, and hands-on field expertise.</p>
